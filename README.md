# Customer Outreach Campaign using CrewAI

This project implements an AI-powered customer outreach system using the CrewAI framework. It defines intelligent agents that collaborate to analyze customer data, generate campaign strategies, and automate outreach tasks.

## Project Description

The notebook demonstrates how to create a team of AI agents (using the CrewAI framework) to simulate a customer outreach campaign. Each agent is assigned a role such as data analyzer, content writer, or strategy planner. The agents work together to execute tasks aimed at increasing customer engagement through automated planning and generation.

## Features

- Multi-agent collaboration with CrewAI
- Definition of custom agents and roles
- Task execution flow using `Crew` class
- Custom tools for outreach and strategy
- Easily extendable for real-world marketing use cases

## Process Overview

1. **Agent Setup**: Define roles for each agent involved in outreach
2. **Tool Design**: Build custom tools for data access, message creation, and targeting
3. **Task Assignment**: Map tasks to agents and sequence execution
4. **Crew Execution**: Run the full outreach workflow using CrewAI
5. **Output Analysis**: Review the outcomes and messages generated

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com) for multi-agent orchestration
- LangChain/OpenAI (if connected for LLM capabilities)
- Custom tools and logic for customer campaign simulation
